4. **location**: Where the scene takes place
5. **timeOfDay**: Time of day (day, night, dawn, dusk, etc.)

## Story Content Guidelines
- **storyContent** should contain the actual story narrative from the script (dialogue, actions, scene descriptions)

- Each storyContent should be substantial and contain the complete story content for that scene
- Include dialogue, character actions, and scene descriptions from the original script
- Make it read like a storybook page with the full narrative
